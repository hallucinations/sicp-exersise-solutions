;;; Newtonâ€™s method for cube roots is based on the fact that if y is an
;;; approximation to the cube root of x, then a better approximation is
;;; given by the value
;;;                ((x / y*y) + (2 * y)) / 3
;;; Use this formula to implement a cube-root procedure analogous to the
;;; square-root procedure.
